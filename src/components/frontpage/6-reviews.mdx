    <h2 className="subtitle">Which library should you use?</h2>

    If there was an easy answer to this question, I wouldn't need to make a website like this. Each
    library has their own set of pros and cons, and in the end the choice comes down to a set of personal and project
    specific preferences.

    I will do my best to present each library as simply as possible, using a very simple demo setup to demonstrate their
    capabilities. That said, the demos are simple and they cannot show the full feature set of each library. The demos
    are but a taste of each library, and to fully know their capacities, you need to check their documentation (which
    I will link to).

<AuthorNote title="Library reviews">
    All being said about presenting the libraries neutrally and impartial, I cannot ignore that I've worked several
    years with some of them, and feel that I should convey my experiences with them somehow. The reviews are my attempt
    at that.

    I've assessed a specific set of aspects for each library. I've focused on attributes of the libraries, grouped into
    Developer Experience, Documentation, Community & Support, Maturity, and ending with an Overall feeling. In the
    following table you can see the complete review of all libraries.

    <strong>All ratings are links that navigates to the explanation of that rating.</strong>

    I hope to keep this site updated with more libraries as I'm getting more familiar with them. Here is the list of
    libaries I want to add in the future:

    * [LINCD.js](https://github.com/Semantu/lincd)
    * [RDF-Ext](https://rdf-ext.org/)
    * [Grapoi](https://github.com/rdf-ext/grapoi)
    * [RDF Object](https://github.com/rubensworks/rdf-object.js)
    * [graphy.js](https://graphy.link/)

<AuthorNote title="My opinion on the matter">
    Although I cannot fully convey everything that the libraries can offer on this website, I hope I'm able to at
    least convey enough of my impressions so that it makes it clear to you in which situations the library suits
    your needs (and for which they lack). For this purpose I want to break down my impressions into categories, and
    I'll try to assess how good a library is on the given category by rating it from 1 to 5. I'll describe what each
    rating means for each category down below.

    Some of these criteria might be unfair to review a library by, and all of these libraries fall short in some
    regard. But I hope to maintain this website over time, and I'll update my reviews as changes happen. Also, the
    choice of these categories are highly subjective, so you might disagree with my perspective altogether. I invite
    criticism, and am open to review my selection of categories and approach of review.

    <h3 className="subtitle">Why I haven't rated performance or payload size</h3>

    Although performance and payload size are important considerations, I don't feel that we're at a point where
    performance is the deciding factor when choosing a library.

    That said, I would love to see someone do some proper testing to get some numbers on these factors. Here's hoping
    someone will take on that gauntlet <GiFingersCrossed/>.
