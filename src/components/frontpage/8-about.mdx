    <h2 className="subtitle">About this website</h2>

    This website is a personal project by [Arne Hassel](https://icanhasweb.net). It is not affiliated with the [RDF/JS
    Community Group](https://rdf.js.org/), although they've graciously allowed me to use their logo for this website.

    This website is created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [React
    Router](https://reactrouter.com/), [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/), and
    [useLocalStorage](https://github.com/nas5w/use-local-storage). It's design is composed
    using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/),
    and [Prism](https://prismjs.com/). It's written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
    [TSX](https://react.dev/learn/typescript), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and [CSS
    Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). For authentication in the Solid demos I've made use of
    [@ldo/solid-react](https://github.com/o-development/ldobjects/tree/main/packages/solid-react).

    The code is available on [the project's GitHub repo](https://github.com/megoth/semtechjs-demo).

            If you found any of the guides difficult to understand, I would love to get your feedback on how they can be
            improved. I usually take suggestions via [issues on the GitHub
            repo](https://github.com/megoth/rdfjs/issues), but if you know me in other channels I love to hear your
            feedback there.

<AuthorNote title={"Why I made this website"}>
    I've created this website in the hopes of providing an educative platform for choosing a library when one
    wants to work with RDF. I've worked with RDF since I wrote my [Master
    Theses](https://graphitethesis.icanhasweb.net/) back in 2012, and although there are some gaps in how much I've been
    able to invest in using it, I feel confident in expressing my opinions on it and related tools, especially those
    geared toward use with JavaScript.

    I'm a moderator at [Solid Community Forum](https://forum.solidproject.org/u/megoth) and
    [r/solid](https://www.reddit.com/r/solid), and interact with the Solid community from time to time. I
    worked at [Inrupt](https://www.inrupt.com/) for four years, and am currently working as a [Senior Consultant
    at Capgemini - Insights and Data](https://www.capgemini.com/services/data-and-ai/).

    I hope you're able to find value in these writings, and that we can have a productive discussion on how
    to improve educational tools like this for users. If you have any issues with the content, please [contact
    me](https://github.com/megoth/semtechjs-demo/issues).
