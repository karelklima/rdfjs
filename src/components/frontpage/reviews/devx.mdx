<h3 className="subtitle is-5">Developer experience</h3>

Which allowances do the library offer developers to overcome their challenges? How easy is the API to get into, to
get something done quickly, and then move on to other problems that need fixing? Is it prone to bugs? Does it guide
developers to handle edge cases in a intuitive manner?
