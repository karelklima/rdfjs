    In the first series of demos I've focused on working locally by storing the data in the browser.
    But RDF is designed to live on the web and be, well, linked! (Hence the popular synonym Linked Data.) The problem
    with this approach is that it requires us to synchronize our data with a web server. Meaning we need some sort of
    authorization on the resources involved, which in turn might require some authentication.

    Luckily, all of this is solved by using <NavLink to="/solid">Solid</NavLink>! As promoted on
    [solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/):

    <blockquote cite="https://solidproject.org/">
        Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods.
        Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they control which
        people and applications can access it.
    </blockquote>

    Do note that even though I've chosen Solid for these demos, most of these should also work nicely with other
    RDF-based systems. You might use another form of authentication, or another server API altogether, but
    as long as they use RDF they should be somewhat interoperable.

    Using Solid I've reimplemented the demos using Pods as storage. These demos retrieve and update the name that's
    located in your WebID resource. This introduces some latency between client and server, and you'll experience some
    loading states when retrieving and posting data.
