    <h2 className="subtitle is-3" className={styles.localTitle}>
        <span>RDF + JS + `localStorage` = </span>
    </h2>

    I'll start by showing how RDF can be manipulated locally in your browser. For each library I've implemented the same
    feature - a simple form that takes your name and saves it to `localStorage` when you submit the form. The demo will
    then retrieve that name when the demo is later reloaded.

    Please click onto one of the demos listed below to see how the feature is implemented in that library. You can
    also navigate to the demos via the libraries listed at the top.
