<h3 className="subtitle is-5">Overall feeling</h3>

This is where I conclude my overall rating of the library. It's based on the other ratings, but there might be
certain something that will improve or decrease the overall score. I've treated myself to be able to set half scores
here, as to indicate that my feeling is somewhere between those two points.
