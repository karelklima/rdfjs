    Although working on RDF locally is useful, it's even more useful when used by multiple actors in real-time.
    Real-time functionality can be complex and offers a lot of challenges though, so it's probably best to use some
    tool to handle it for us.

    Currently there is only one demo for this section, but I hope to expand it with more in the future as I learn of
    more peer-to-peer technologies offering real-time functionality with RDF.
