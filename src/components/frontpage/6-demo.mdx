    All of the demos use the same component, the `Demo` component. It takes two properties, `name` and `onSubmit`. The
    component presents a form with one simple text input, which presents the name. The form can be submitted, at which
    point the function `onSubmit` will be called.

    The demo below will not store anything, so refreshing the webpage will reset all changes.

<Content>
    This code is written in [TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), a language that combines
    Typescript and ESM files. It's specifically written with React in mind, and relies a lot on [React
    Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react). That said, I think the overall abstractions are clear, and I'll walk you
    through the various parts:

        I'm making use of [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/)'s `useForm` to handle form states.
        The `FormData` interface only has one attribute: name. This hook provides us with functionality that
        manages the data flow of the form element at line 33. Also note `useEffect` at line 21, that updates the
        value of name in the form if name is updated elsewhere.

        Whenever the name successfully submits, we want to notify the user.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["19", "24-27", "41"]} title="Throttling submits">
        Whenever we're working with asynchronous functionality when submitting, there might be a delay when
        where things are being updated. Given this behavior, I want to limit when a user can submit updates so that they
        cannot spam the submit-button.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["16", "26"]} title="Relaying name and onSubmit">
        We pass the data submitted to the parent demo code, which provide the specific logic that should
        be done when form is submitted.

        The important part of all of this is that `name` is actually handled in the parent element, which is where
        the logic of the demo resides (and which I'll show in the respective code section). It basically only
        provides a form that calls on `onSubmit` when submitted.
