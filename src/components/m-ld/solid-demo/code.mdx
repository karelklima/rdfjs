    This demo requires you to authenticate with a Solid account.

    Based on the first demo we can add persistent storage with Solid by adding some logic to the first demo that handles
    the genesis clone. A lot of the code is the same, so I'll point out the new parts in this walkthrough.

<Code language="tsx" id="SolidDemo" code={solidDemoCode} className="line-numbers">
    <CodeStep lines={["17-20", "29-30"]} title="Load resource and profile">
        I use <NavLink to="/ldo">LDO</NavLink> to load the WebID resource. This allows us to load the profile with the
        name that is already connected to a Solid account. While this is loading we won't start the clone creation.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["45-54"]} title="Relaying updates to Solid">
        Whenever an updated name is submitted I pass the new value so that the WebID resource is updated.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["47"]} title="Let user know that something went wrong">
        If for some reason something went wrong when setting up the demo, this should we relayed to the user.
    </CodeStep>
</Code>

<AuthorNote title="Solid and real-time updates">
    Note that when you connect to other storages except the one provided by m-ld, you should make sure that peers
    connect to unique storages. If multiple peers connect to the same storage, there is a chance that you get feedback
    effects.

    This demo only connects to one Solid storage, but it could easily be extended to allow each peer to be
    connected to a separate storage, e.g. for chat clients where each participant want to store parts or the whole
    exchange of messages in their respective storages.

    Solid servers *might* have some websockets features available, but the specification isn't complete yet, so I would
    be hesitant to rely only Solid for real-time updates (for now).
