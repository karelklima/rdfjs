<AuthorNote id="review" title="Should you choose m-ld?">
    I haven't used m-ld for a long time, but I'm impressed with what it already offers. I'm also impressed by the
    ambitions of the team working on it, planning to eventually support a common API across multiple platforms, and
    should make it a perfect choice for organizations that need that.

    I also like their approach by focusing on (more) accessible standards such as JSON, but using RDF internally to
    represent the data, and enhancing the API with semantic capabilities when needed. I've also talked a bit with its
    creator, George Svarovsky, after he [suggested I try their
    JS-library](https://forum.solidproject.org/t/rdf-js/7034/4), and have gotten some help and insights.

    Although there is still work to be done, they've managed to get m-ld to version 0.10.0 and they want to push it to
    [version 1.0.0 after some rigorous testing to know that it's fully production
    ready](https://m-ld.org/news/#news_2023-10-04). Their business model isn't fully in place yet, but they promise that
    it will always be open-source, and free for personal use and public good.

    If I was to make a recommendation, I would **definitely check it out if you have a project that combines real-time
    updates and RDF resources**, or maybe something that starts local-first, but expands to a P2P-network when needed
    (e.g. most collaborative tools).
