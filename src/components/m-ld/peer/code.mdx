    <CodeStep lines={["16-17"]} title={<>Getting <code>domainId</code> and setting <code>domainUrl</code></>}>
        As I mentioned in the previous demo, `domainId` is passed as part of the URL. `useParams` allows us to get the
        part of the URL that contains the `domainId`, and we make sure that we get the same URL for `domainUrl` as the
        genesis clone. We also use `domainId` to indicate the id of the model itself (allows us to only send one
        variable instead of two).
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["18", "24-29", "41"]} title="Connecting to the network">
        In this part of the code we don't wait for an explicit initiation by the user, as loading the peers implicitly
        counts as that. Note that we set `genesis` to `false`, and keep a reference to the clone in `peer` so that we
        can use it later when submitting updates to the name.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["19", "30-42"]} title="Read initial model and updates">
        We again make use of the `read` API to get the current name. The first handler gets the first write from the
        genesis clone, while the second handler gets the updates from the other, non-genesis peer. All updates are
        packaged into an object `profile`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["48-60"]} title="Submit form and update network">
        Once we get a submit event from the user, we update the graph by deleting the existing profile and create a new
        object with the new name.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["20", "43", "49", "57-59", "64-69"]} title="Error handling">
        Although the error handling is crude (it either succeed or fails, no attempts to mitigate errors
        that might arise), I've added a reload-button to allow users to more easily refresh the content of the iframes
        (which might resolve errors that comes from timeouts and not being able to connect to the messaging network).
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["70"]} title="Do not notify the user">
        We've centralized the notification to the genesis peer, so I opt out of the notification for the peer demos by
        using the `noNotify` property. (The notifications would show up in the upper right corner of the iframe, which
        doesn't look very good.)
