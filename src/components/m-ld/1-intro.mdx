    m-ld (pronounced *meld*) is a decentralised live information sharing component with a JSON-based API. Currently it's
    only supported in one programming language ([JavaScript](https://js.m-ld.org/)), but the goal for the team behind
    m-ld is to implement it as a system built on a decentralised protocol that's shares a [standardized
    API](https://spec.m-ld.org/) across various programming languages and platforms. The idea is that a network of peers
    can collaborate by sharing <abbr title="Conflict-free Replicated Data Type">CRDT</abbr>s, in essence creating a
    distributed graph. (I won't be going into details on what CRDTs are here, but I've written <NavLink to="/crdt">a
    tiny guide</NavLink> on it.)

    Although m-ld uses RDF internally, you might not be aware of that when working with it (although a big hint is in
    m-*ld*, i.e. Linked Data). That is by design. The data is represented in the APIs by JSON, meaning there are no
    semantics in the model, but developers can opt into using vocabularies to enable interoperability. It has
    implemented parts of the [RDF/JS specs](https://rdf.js.org/), such as querying using
    [json-rql](https://json-rql.org/), which is a JSON-based query language that's based on <NavLink
    to="/sparql">SPARQL</NavLink>, or you can use tools that return a SPARQL Algebra object (like
    [SPARQLAlgebra.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sparqlalgebrajs)).

    m-ld is agnostic in terms of which messaging technology you must use, and currently support three implementations
    ([MQTT](https://mqtt.org/), [Ably](https://ably.com/), [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)). No matter which you choose,
    we now get *real-time updates* when data changes in another peer's graph. This allows us to merge those updates into
    our local graph, and work with a (most probably) up-to-date distributed graph. This is useful for a lot of
    use-cases, such as chatting, real-time collaboration on documents, etc. The team behind m-ld also offers [m-ld
    gateway](https://gw.m-ld.org/) where you can test out your apps using Socket.io.
