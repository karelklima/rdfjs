        I'm making use of the public gateway that the m-ld team provides for testing purposes, which means I need to
        generate a unique id, which I do with the `uuid` method. The `domainId` is provided to the peers by URLs, and
        I'll explain how that's used in the peer demo.

    <CodeStep lines={["13", "19", "44"]} title="Waiting until user initiates the demo">
        As explained, starting the demo requires a bit of setup. This is how we wait for the user's explicit request to
        start the demo. We make use of the `MLdInitStep` component, which simply shows a button that sets `init` to
        `true` once the user presses the button.

        I want to make sure that the initial clone is properly set up before loading in the peers.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["20-39"]} title="Starting genesis clone">
        Once the user has initiated the demo, we create a genesis clone. Once it's up and going, we start by sending a
        "default" state with `write`, i.e. set the name to `P2P test`. We also use the `read` API by passing two
        functions, one for the first read, and the second for updates. Since this peer does initial writing, we simply
        ignore the first handler. The second function handles the updates that come from the other clones.
    </CodeStep>

        Once we've set up the genesis clone, we load the peers by using the `MLdDemo` component.

    <CodeStep lines={["15", "36"]} title="Notifying user">
        Once an update is provided, this bit simply notifies the user with a message in the upper right corner.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["16", "41", "48"]} title="Error handling">
        There are quite a few things that can go wrong when working with real-time updates. This is not unlike working
        with asynchronous, external resources in general, but socket communication introduces some extra challenges as
        well. This should mostly be handled by m-ld, but in case there are unavoidable errors, I catch them with this
        part of the code.
