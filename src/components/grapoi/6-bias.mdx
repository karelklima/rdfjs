<AuthorNote title="My bias with Inrupt">
    I've worked at Inrupt for four years, and have in those years worked with a lot of developers there, some of
    whom I recognize as friend to this day. I'm very much biased toward Inrupt as a company.

    I've also used these libraries as part of my work at Inrupt, and have been part of the quality assurance part of it,
    by testing and giving feedback to the developers. Developers who I also communicated with often.

    So I'm very familiar with the various APIs, and although I enjoy working with them, it's not what I'm being drawn
    to currently. So I think I'm able to remain impartial to Inrupt and their work.
