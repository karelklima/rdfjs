        @inrupt/solid-client, which is the library that you will be using most, offers an extensive API for managing RDF
        in the style of functional programming. While I do enjoy the abstractions into `SolidDataset` and `Thing`, it
        still requires me to understand quite a bit of RDF.

        For example, to know which attribute to read and update name we must know of `foaf:name`. This is definitely
        something developers _should_ know when they're working with RDF, but I would argue that it's suboptimal if
        there is an alternative where you don't need to know it (i.e. like LDO allows).

        The documentation of Inrupt is really good. It can be a bit overwhelming at first because of the sheer size of
        the API (again, focusing on @inrupt/solid-client), but once you understand its logic (which is test and tried
        format used in many other documentations), you get around quickly.

        Although there isn't an active community around Inrupt's JavaScript client libraries, some of its developers
        hang around the [forum](https://forum.solidproject.org/) and other places where questions of the library might
        be asked, and are quick to answer.

        The libraries in Inrupt's portfolio have mostly been around for some years now. There might pop up a bug from
        time to time, but the developer team is fairly quick to respond.

        Overall I enjoy using Inrupt's JavaScript client libraries, and I certainly appreciate what it and its
        developers have done to the Solid community. But I'm not especially fond of functional programming, and the
        sequential feel of it all feels a bit like working with boxes within boxes within boxes. You have to explicitly
        package and un-package each box for things you want to do, and ironically it doesn't provide a good flow for me.

        But in the end, Inrupt provides a stable API that gets the job done. It's abstractions are higher than
        rdflib.js, and doesn't require as much from developers to get into. And if you like the functional programming
        style, you'll love this library.
