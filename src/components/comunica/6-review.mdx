<AuthorNote title="Should you choose Comunica?">
    I haven't worked enough with Comunica and SPARQL to tell you whether or not this is a good match for your needs.
    My suspicion is that the SPARQL requirement is a bit to much to get front-end developers into. That said, SPARQL is
    very powerful, and if it's a requirement that the client should be able to execute queries, then you probably want
    to check out Comunica.
