    Comunica is a graph querying framework created by researchers at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/)
    and is currently developed by the [Comunica Association](https://comunica.dev/association/). It's focus lies on
    queries, which in the field of semantic technologies usually means SPARQL. If you're unfamiliar with SPARQL, I
    recommend you reading the <NavLink to="/sparql">SPARQL guide</NavLink>.
