<AuthorNote title="Should you choose Comunica?">
    I haven't worked enough with Comunica and SPARQL to tell you whether or not this is a good match for your needs.
    My suspicion is that SPARQL is a bit to much to get front-end developers into. That said, SPARQL is very powerful,
    and if it's a requirement that the client should be able to execute queries, then you probably want to check out
    Comunica.
