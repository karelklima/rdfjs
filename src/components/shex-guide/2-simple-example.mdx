    Let's start with an example that describes a ShEx-shape we can use for the data model used in the demos on this
    website:

<Code language="turtle" code={shexExample} id={"ShexExample"} noCopy={true}/>

    In this example we see the shape `ProfileShape` with one attribute, `foaf:name`. It's datatype, `xsd:string`, has a
    cardinality token, `?`, meaning that it can be zero or one occurrences of it. This is the shape needed to make our
    demos with <StyledLink href="/ldo">LDO</StyledLink> work.
