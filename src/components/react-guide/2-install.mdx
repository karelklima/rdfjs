    To get started with React, simply install it using your favorite package manager:

<Install name="react"/>

    Next you'll have to choose how you want React to be integrated into your site. Most people want to use it for

<Install name="react-dom"/>

    Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is probably your choice:

<Install name="react-router-dom"/>
