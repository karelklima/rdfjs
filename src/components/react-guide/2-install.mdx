    We add [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) to integrate React with the webpage. You also probably
    want some way of managing routes in your application, in which case [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is
    probably your choice. You might switch these out depending on your needs (e.g. if you're working on a React Native
    app you'll switch out react-dom, and maybe you don't even need react-router-dom).
