    <h2 className="subtitle">Alternatives</h2>

    As big as the front-end community is there is going to be a lot of alternatives to React. And some people can be
    quite antagonistic in their defense of their favorite tool, so I thought it reasonable to write this section about
    other alternatives and justify my choice of React.

    * [Vue](https://vuejs.org/): I've heard that this is a really good alternative to React. Many feel that its API
    allows for better problem solving, with a more complete API (whereas React only focuses on state and DOM
    management). I'm not very familiar with Vue though, and haven't been able to go through more than tutorials with it.
    * [Angular](https://angular.io/): Another great framework that's apparently quite popular amongst enterprise
    developers. It's built with TypeScript in mind, and leverages a lot of its power to provide a unique and intuitive
    API. I do have a lot of experience with its predecessor, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), but not so much with
    Angular.
    * [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): Svelte is technically its own language, but looks and behaves very much like
    JavaScript. It's designed to be compiled into optimized code, and supposedly does this in a manner that makes it
    very popular amongst front-end developers. Alas, again, not much experience on my behalf with this library.
    * [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/): An up-and-coming library that features blazingly fast state handling with
    JSX. I've tried this out a bit, as well as the work it's based on, [S.js](https://github.com/adamhaile/S), and it's
    very good. But it's not as tested and tried as React, and I wanted something that was more streamlined for this
    website.

    By now you've probably spotted the reoccurring theme: I'm simply not as skilled in the other alternatives. I've
    coded a lot of React projects throughout the years, and I'm invested into using it at this point. Maybe I'll choose
    another at some point, but that day is not today.

    The point is that it's my weapon of choice, and you are free to use whichever you want. I truly believe that the
    overall abstractions that the code convey are useful enough to make you able to reuse the core parts of into
    your own weapon of choice.
