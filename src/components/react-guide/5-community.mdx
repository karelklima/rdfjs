    Another great aspect of using React is being able to partake in the React community. React has a lot of developers
    using it, so many problems you face have been solved by the community already.

    There is also a lot of tools being built around it (this website being one example of that), with popular frameworks
    such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) serving it explicitly or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that treats it as a
    first-class citizen.
