    <h2 className="subtitle">State Handling</h2>

    Another important feature of React is state handling. There has been many best practices of how to deal with
    challenges such as global states, communicating between components, and handling UI updates to communicate
    effectively what's going on for the user.

    The winning approach in recent years seems to be using [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react). This also
    allows global communication using [React Contexts](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext), and various ways
    handling variable states that can be optimized wrt memory usage (e.g. by using `useMemo`).

    I don't want to go to deep into this, but know that one of reasons that React is so popular today is how well it
    handles state management for you. (That is not to say it isn't confusing as hell at times, and feels like it works
    against you at times, but state management is hard by default, and for all it faults, React does it comparatively
    well.)
