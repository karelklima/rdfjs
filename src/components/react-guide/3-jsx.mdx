    <h2 className="subtitle">JSX</h2>

    One of it's most important features is the possibility of writing [markup using
    JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx). This extension of JavaScript allows you to write code like
    the following:
</Content>

<Code language="tsx" id="JsxExample" code={jsxExample} noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    These functions are called **components**, and React apps composes one or more (usually a lot more) components. As
    this website is a React app as well, we can include this function as well:
</Content>

<Box>
    <JsxExample/>
</Box>

<Content>
    And our component, `JsxExample`, is then reused again in the code running parts of this page as well, as seen in
    <CodeLink id="meta" lines={["4", "26"]}>lines 4 and 26</CodeLink> in the code below.
</Content>

<Code language="tsx" id="meta" code={thisCode} noCopy={true} className="line-numbers"/>

<AuthorNote title="It's actually MDX!">
    To be completely clear, this is actually [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/), which is an extension of JSX.
    But don't you love how self-referential we can be when coding?

    (I couldn't let this chance go =P )

<AuthorNote title="It's actually TSX!">
    And yes, technically I'm also using [TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), which is a
    TypeScript-supported version of JSX. Lots of fun tools to make things more complicated, sure, but the end result is
    so nice to work with ^_^

    (Well, for me at least =P )
