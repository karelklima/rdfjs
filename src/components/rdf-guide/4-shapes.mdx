    <h2 className="subtitle">Shapes</h2>

    Shapes are standards that describe which properties a RDF graph should have. They can be used to validate RDF
    graphs (e.g. graphs with values that we've populated using user input), but more importantly they allow a human
    interface to what could be an otherwise complex data model. (Don't fret though, shapes can be very complex as well,
    some things are just really hard to describe.)

    The two prominent shapes standard today are [ShEx](https://shex.io/) and [SHACL](https://shacl.org/). They have
    different goals and features, but a lot of the core is the same. I would argue that ShEx is easier to get into and
    read, but that SHACL has a wider feature set. I don't have the expertise to advise you on which you should choose,
    but I trust it's probably something like "it depends".

    I've written a <NavLink to="/shex">guide on ShEx</NavLink>, as it's a standard used by <NavLink
    to="/ldo">LDO</NavLink>. I personally find ShEx easier, and therefore better, to use in general, but I also don't
    have to much experience with SHACL, so I might be wrong.
