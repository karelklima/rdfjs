    <h2 className="subtitle">Shapes</h2>

    Shapes are standards that describe which properties a RDF graph should have. They can be used to validate RDF
    graphs (e.g. graphs with values that we've populated using user input), but more importantly they allow a human
    interface to what could be an otherwise complex data model. (Don't fret though, shapes can be very complex as well,
    some things are just really hard to describe.)

    The two prominent shapes standard today are [ShEx](https://shex.io/) and [SHACL](https://shacl.org/). They have
    different goals and features, but a lot of the core is the same. I would argue that ShEx is easier to get into and
    read, but that SHACL has a wider feature set. I don't have the expertise to advise you on which you should choose,
    but I trust it's probably something like "it depends".

    I've written a <StyledLink href="/shex">guide on ShEx</StyledLink>, as it's a standard used by <StyledLink
    href="/ldo">LDO</StyledLink>. I personally find ShEx easier, and therefore better, to use in general, but I also
    don't have to much experience with SHACL, so I might be wrong.

    <h3 className="subtitle">Interoperability</h3>

    As mentioned in the section on vocabularies, interoperability is a core tenet of RDF. Lets show this with some
    examples.
</Content>

<Code code={personTurtle} id="EX1_personTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>
<Code code={organizationTurtle} id="EX1_organizationTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    These RDF graphs don't share any attributes, so they are *not interoperable*. But if you were to merge the following
    graph:
</Content>

<Code code={nameInteroperabilityTurtle} id="EX1_nameInteroperabilityTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    Now we would now have interoperability for the names of these entities. Granted, these examples are a bit
    constructed, but you could easily imagine apps using two vocabularies from two different organizations being able to
    merge the data used by the vocabularies in a *meaningful, semantic way*.

    <h4 className="subtitle">Shapes and interoperability</h4>

    But whereas vocabularies *allow* RDF to be interoperable, shapes *ensures* that it actually *is* interoperable.
    Let's see some more examples:
</Content>

<Code code={personTurtle} id="EX2_personTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>
<Code code={person2Turtle} id="EX2_person2Turtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    Again we see a turtle for person named "Arne" in example 1, and a person named "Tim" in example 2. The different
    types might indicate that these graphs are not interoperable, while the reuse of `foaf:name` might indicate that
    they are. And what about `foaf:knows`, should that be a requirement?

    To answer these questions we can use a ShEx-shape to describe the following:
</Content>

<Code code={personShape} id="EX2_personShape" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    This shape tells us that we want a graph that has *either* `foaf:Person` or `schema:Person` (or *both*), but both
    uses `foaf:name` Also notice that it doesn't say anything about `foaf:knows`, which means that for the purposes of
    that shape, it doesn't care about it. But it doesn't exclude the use of it either, so using this shape we could say
    that the RDF graphs describing the persons are interoperable.

    (If you want to learn more about shapes, you could read the <NavLink to="/shex">guide on ShEx</NavLink>.)

    <h4 className="subtitle">Extendability</h4>

    I've mentioned a couple of times that RDF can be extended. But what does that actually look like. Well, let's look
    at another example:
</Content>

<Code code={person2AlternateTurtle} id="EX2_person2AlternateShape" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    In this example we've added another triple (`:tim a myVocabulary:Legend .`) which introduces a new vocabulary,
    `myVocabulary`. This is an entirely fictional vocabulary, but as long as I'd the possibility of adding a resource to
    example.org (which I sadly don't), I could mint any vocabulary I felt necessary.

    Theoretically we could also merge the graphs from the example above with any other graphs, and we would still have a
    valid RDF graph. (And if we had used something like OWL to formally define our vocabulary, we could also automate
    how the graphs are merged as well, but that's outside the scope of this guide.)
