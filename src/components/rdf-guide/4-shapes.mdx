    <h2 className="subtitle">Shapes</h2>

    Shapes are standards that describe which properties a RDF graph should have. They can be used to validate RDF
    graphs (e.g. graphs with values that we've populated using user input), but more importantly they allow a human
    interface to what could be an otherwise complex data model. (Don't fret though, shapes can be very complex as well,
    some things are just really hard to describe.)

    The two prominent shapes standard today are [ShEx](https://shex.io/) and [SHACL](https://shacl.org/). They have
    different goals and features, but a lot of the core is the same. I would argue that ShEx is easier to get into and
    read, but that SHACL has a wider feature set. I don't have the expertise to advise you on which you should choose,
    but I trust it's probably something like "it depends".

    I've written a <NavLink to="/shex">guide on ShEx</NavLink>, as it's a standard used by <NavLink
    to="/ldo">LDO</NavLink>. I personally find ShEx easier, and therefore better, to use in general, but I also don't
    have to much experience with SHACL, so I might be wrong.

    <h4 className="subtitle">Shapes and interoperability</h4>

    Whereas vocabularies *allow* RDF to be interoperable, shapes *ensures* that it actually *is* interoperable.
    Let's see some more examples:
</Content>

<Code code={personTurtle} id="EX2_personTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>
<Code code={person2Turtle} id="EX2_person2Turtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    Again we see a turtle for person named "Arne" in example 1, and a person named "Tim" in example 2. The different
    types might indicate that these graphs are not interoperable, while the reuse of `foaf:name` might indicate that
    they are. And what about `foaf:knows`, should that be a requirement?

    To answer these questions we can use a ShEx-shape to describe the following:
</Content>

<Code code={personShape} id="EX2_personShape" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    This shape tells us that we want a graph that has *either* `foaf:Person` or `schema:Person` (or *both*), but both
    uses `foaf:name` Also notice that it doesn't say anything about `foaf:knows`, which means that for the purposes of
    that shape, it doesn't care about it. But it doesn't exclude the use of it either, so using this shape we could say
    that the RDF graphs describing the persons are interoperable.
