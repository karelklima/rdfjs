    <h1 className="title">RDF</h1>

    There are <StyledLink href="#recommendations">several resources I can recommend to get you started</StyledLink> (and
    I do encourage you to check them out), but for the purpose of this website I'll give you a quick introduction to
    what RDF is all about.

    RDF is an abbreviation for **Resource Description Framework**. It's a framework for representing information on the
    web. It's a semantic technology in that its fundamental building stone, the triple, is based on the human language.
    This allows us to express relationships using human language, where entities such as persons can be represented as
    nodes and the relationships going from one to the other as edges. These directed graphs are what we call **RDF
    graphs**. They describe a set of statements, which themselves consists of three parts - a **triple**. These parts
    are the **Subject**, the **Predicate**, and the **Object**.

    A classic depiction of this is:

    <picture className="image">
        <img src="/triple.png" style={{maxHeight: 100, width: "auto"}}
             alt={`A diagram representing a triple with the Subject, the Predicate, and the Object.`}/>
    </picture>

    Another important feature of RDF is that **nodes and edges are IRIs** (similar to URLs) that represent them, and all
    denoted things have unique IRIs. So another way of expressing the depiction above is with text:
</Content>

<Code code={tripleTurtle} id="textTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    (This statement is expressed using [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), one of many serializations of RDF.)

    Objects can also be **Literals**, which can be strings, numbers, dates, or whatever data type you want (you can even
    specify your own). Strings can also be language-tagged, meaning you can have translated strings for labels and other
    terms that are useful.

    These simple rules allow us to connect multiple nodes so that we can describe larger graphs, like the graph below:
</Content>

<Code code={profileTurtle} id="textTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    In this example we also see the syntax `@prefix` that allows us to shorten IRIs, the <a
    href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF vocabulary</a>, the shorthand `a` for `rdf:type`, and literals (e.g. `"Arne
    Hassel"`). FOAF (an acronym for "Friend of a Friend") is a well established vocabulary to describe social attributes
    and relationships, e.g. name and contacts, and we use `foaf:name` to describe a person's name. We also make use of
    [schema.org](https://schema.org/) to describe the organization Capgemini.

    The code can also be depicted as the following:

    <picture className="image">
        <img src="/profile.png" style={{maxHeight: 500, width: "auto"}}
             alt={`A diagram representing a graph with a simple profile.`}/>
    </picture>

    If you understand this, you understand more than enough to understand the data model that I've used in the demos.

<AuthorNote title={"Why are RDF, Linked Data, and the Semantic Web sometimes used interchangeably?"}>
    When people talk about RDF, they sometimes interchangeably use Linked Data and/or the Semantic Web to refer to
    it. Linked Data and the Semantic Web have their own separate meaning, the former describing RDF when used to
    *connect data on the web*, and the latter being a popular branding term for RDF in the past. So if anything you
    might infer when a person was acquainted to RDF by which synonym they use. <abbr
    title="In My Honest Opinion">IMHO</abbr> it's not important to distinguish between these terms, if anything, it
    might introduce more variety in our texts. My personal preference is Linked Data (and yes, I do use the terms
    interchangeably often, so I might be very opinionated in this regard), but I'll stick to RDF for this
    website.
