    <h1 className="title">RDF</h1>

    There are <NavLink to="#recommendations">several resources I can recommend to get you started</NavLink> (and I do
    encourage you to check them out), but for the purpose of this website I'll give you a quick introduction to what RDF
    is all about.

    RDF is an abbreviation for **Resource Description Framework**. It's a framework for representing information on the
    web. It's a semantic technology in that its fundamental building stone, the triple, is based on the human language.
    This allows us to express relationships using human language, where entities such as persons can be represented as
    nodes and the relationships going from one to the other as edges. These directed graphs are what we call **RDF
    graphs**. They describe a set of statements, which themselves consists of three parts - a **triple**. These parts
    are the **Subject**, the **Predicate**, and the **Object**.

    A classic depiction of this is:

    <picture className="image">
        <img src="/triple.png" style={{maxHeight: 100, width: "auto"}}
             alt={`A diagram representing a triple with the Subject, the Predicate, and the Object.`}/>
    </picture>

    Another important feature of RDF is that **nodes and edges are IRIs** (similar to URLs) that represent them, and all
    denoted things have unique IRIs. So another way of expressing the depiction above is with text:
</Content>

<Code code={tripleTurtle} id="textTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    This statement is expressed using [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), one of many serializations of RDF
    (there's also [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), [RDFa](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/),
    [RDF/XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/), and more).

    This simple construct also allows us to connect multiple nodes so that we can describe larger graphs. Given the
    turtle below:
</Content>

<Code code={profileTurtle} id="textTurtle" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    The code can be depicted as the following:

    <picture className="image">
        <img src="/profile.png" style={{maxHeight: 130, width: "auto"}}
             alt={`A diagram representing a graph with a simple profile.`}/>
    </picture>

    In this example we also see the syntax `@prefix` that allows us to shorten IRIs, the <a
    href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF vocabulary</a>, the shorthand `a` for
    `rdf:type`, and literals (i.e. `"Arne Hassel"`). FOAF (an acronym for "Friend of a Friend") is a well established
    vocabulary to describe social attributes and relationships, e.g. name and contacts, and we use `foaf:name` to
    describe a person's name. This is the model we use for the Solid apps on this website, so understanding this model
    is enough to get into how the Solid demos work.

<AuthorNote title={"Why are RDF, Linked Data, and the Semantic Web sometimes used interchangeably?"}>
    When people talk about RDF, they might interchangeably use Linked Data and/or the Semantic Web to refer to
    it. Linked Data and the Semantic Web are popular branding terms for RDF throughout the years, so if anything you
    might infer when a person was acquainted to RDF by which synonym they use. None of the terms are wrong to use. My
    personal preference is Linked Data, but I'll stick to RDF for this website.
