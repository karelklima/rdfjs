    <h2 className="subtitle">Querying</h2>

    An important feature of any data model is the ability to query, either for specific data points or relationships.
    The most advanced querying language of RDF is [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), which has a
    wide set of query capabilities. I've written a <NavLink to={"/sparql"}>small guide</NavLink> on it as an
    introduction, and there are some resources in it if you want to dive deeper into it.

    <h3 className="subtitle">Querying and interoperability</h3>

    The interoperability features mentioned earlier can also be used to enhance querying capabilities. Using terms like
    `owl:sameAs` you could infer new triples from existing data. Take this example:

    1. Given `Dataset A`, which is described by `Vocabulary A`, and
    2. Given `Dataset B`, which is described by `Vocabulary B`, you can
    3. Define a third, `Vocabulary C`, that describes how terms in `Dataset A` is interoperable with `Dataset B` (if at
    all)

    With this you should theoretically be able to take a query that is used for `Dataset A` and execute it for `Dataset
    B`. There might not be a complete overlap between the two former vocabularies, and that might be ok, but we can
    still get valuable information out of it. (Although the combination of two datasets that have such attributes that
    they disallow some queries probably requires a bit of extra work anyway, so if anything it might be a
    indicator of how useful the combination actually is.)
