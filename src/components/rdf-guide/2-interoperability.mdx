    <h2 className="subtitle">Interoperability</h2>

    Interoperability is a prime features of RDF, but *how* does it actually work? I like to think of interoperability in
    RDF as an interwoven tapestry, where the complete product is the concept of interoperability, and the threads and
    techniques involved are how interoperability is made possible.

    Although the term interoperability has a clear meaning, i.e. that two or more pieces of software can use the same
    data and communicate using the same language and terms, the technical parts of how this is done in RDF is dependent
    on which layer you're looking at. For that reason I've broken down interoperability into a subsection for each part
    of this page, so that I can focus on what interoperability means for that part of RDF.

    One important basic of RDF that allow for all the interoperability that RDF provides, are **IRIs as unique id for
    terms**. This allows people across domains to express themselves and to refer to each other (which incidentally
    also fosters *the need* for interoperability), and they can start to *agree* to which terms they want to both use so
    that they can communicate effectively.

<AuthorNote title="The power!">
    <abbr title="In My Honest Opinion">IMHO</abbr> it seems that interoperability is highly undervalued by the leading
    technology providers that rules the web today. This it understandable, as for-profit organizations usually find
    higher profits in *keeping* their data and their knowledge to themselves, than to *share* it with the public. And
    if they share, they share as little as possible (i.e. only the parts that makes more money by making it open). So
    the fact that interoperability has a high value for the end-user (or consumer, if you prefer), does not tip the
    scale when it has so low value for capitalists, i.e. the usual choice-makers. (I know, I know, this sounds very
    anti-capitalistic â€” oh well ^_^)

    I'll admit that the statement above has its flaws, but if there's anything to it I'm amazed that the choice-makers
    don't understand the power (and value) interoperability can have. By leading (or partaking) in the process of making
    your and your competitors data interoperable, you're contributing to *the language* that will define the domain that
    your business implement tools for. And although a standardization process is (or should be) designed to weed out any
    biases, there is no denying that there will be a limited number of participants in the process, and any
    representative they can get into it will affect the terminology used by their respective business. That should mean
    that your business is better aligned to serve that business, i.e. make more money.

    In any case, another important feature of interoperability and RDF is that it's built *on the web*. The web
    is decentralized, which means that anyone with a resource on the web can use it to describe a vocabulary, and anyone
    is free to use (or not use) that vocabulary. This should provide incentive for the vocabulary designers to make sure
    that they're terms are useful for the end-users.
