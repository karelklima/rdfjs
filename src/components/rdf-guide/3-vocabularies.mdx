    <h2 className="subtitle">Vocabularies</h2>

    RDF is designed to be extended, and one way of grouping these extensions are what we call vocabularies. Vocabularies
    are useful sets of terms that describes useful properties for a data model. Using these vocabularies we can ensure
    that our data is **interoperable**, which is a core tenet of RDF.

    Vocabularies have an important role in **client-to-client standards**, as the metadata it describes can be used by
    developers to ensure that their data is correctly attributed. But there's one thing missing to make sure that apps
    can be interoperable, and that is a way to describe how our graph should *look*. For this we have shapes.

    But *how* is RDF extended through vocabularies? Well, let's look at another example:

<Code code={person2AlternateTurtle} id="EX2_person2AlternateShape" language="turtle" noCopy={true}/>

<Content>
    In this example we have a triple (`:tim a myVocabulary:Legend .`) which introduces a new vocabulary,
    `myVocabulary`. This is an entirely fictional vocabulary, but as long as I can add resources to a web server, I can
    mint as many vocabularies as I feel is necessary. And this is part of the power of RDF (which leads from a property
    of the web in general): There is no authority that controls which vocabularies you use to describe your data. But if
    we want to ensure that our data stays interoperable between apps we have another tool to help us, namely **shapes**.

<AuthorNote title="Ontologies">
    People may use the word ontology interchangeably with the word vocabulary. <abbr
    title="As Far As I Know">AFAIK</abbr> there is no formal distinction between the two terms in how they're used
    within RDF, but some people like to attribute a stricter formal model to ontologies, like using using <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/OWL/"><abbr title="Web Ontology Language">OWL</abbr></a> to describe formal logic. I
    don't think there's anything wrong with using the terms interchangeably, but it's good to be aware.
