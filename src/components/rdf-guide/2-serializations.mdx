    <h2 className="subtitle">Serializations</h2>

    An important thing to understand about RDF is that it's **an abstract data model**. That means that in itself, it
    doesn't prescribe how to *serialize* the data, meaning how the data is transcribed into text. There are multiple
    standards for doing this though, and it allows you to mix and match based on your needs (e.g. some formats are
    better for human interaction, while others are more efficient for computers to parse). The standards have also
    varied in popularity, e.g. for a while RDF/XML was really popular because of the popularity (or requirement...) of
    XML, e.g. in XML standards like [SOAP](http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP). Now it seems that [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
    is rising into prominence backed on the popularity of [JSON](https://www.json.org/). They are all useful, although
    some are more human readable than others.

    Below are some common serializations:

<AuthorNote title="Which serialization should you choose?">
    My personal preference is Turtle, since it's in my mind the easiest to read and communicate to people who don't know
    about RDF. But I see a lot of power that developers have for JSON, so I'm liking JSON-LD a lot too. In the end,
    since all serializations are interoperable, it doesn't really matter which one you choose, as it's the underlying
    RDF graph that you will be working with in the end.
