    <h2 className="subtitle">Querying</h2>

    An important feature of any data model is the ability to query, either for specific data points or relationships.
    The most advanced querying language of RDF is [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), which has a
    wide set of query capabilities. I've written a <StyledLink href={"/sparql"}>small guide</StyledLink> on it as an
    introduction, and there are some resources in it if you want to dive deeper into it.
