    This demo saves the underlying turtle in `localStorage`. It no turtle is found, a default one is used:

    <CodeStep lines={["11-12"]} title="Prepare turtle and state object">
        I want to store any changes to the RDF graph as turtle in `localStorage`. The `useLocalStorage` hook helps me
        with this. Also, I want to traverse the RDF graph using the [Grapoi API](https://rdf-ext.org/api/grapoi.html),
        a RDF-Ext module, so I keep track of it as well.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["13"]} title="Derive name">
        By using the `Grapoi.out` function I get to the object of `foaf:name`; The object is a literal, and I get the
        value by calling `[object].value`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["14", "20", "33", "36"]} title="Error handling">
        I keep track of any errors that might occur and pass them to the `Demo` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["17-20"]} title="Parsing turtle">
        By using `rdf.io.dataset.fromText` I can parse the turtle string into a RDF graph that can be used to initiate
        the Grapoi object.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["23-25"]} title="Loading state">
        It can take some time to parse the turtle string, so while we wait I show the `Loading` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["29-32"]} title={<>Update RDF graph and <code>localStorage</code></>}>
        When the user submits the form I use `Grapoi.deleteOut` and `Grapoi.addOut` to replace the name in the
        underlying RDF graph. I then serialize the graph using `rdf.io.dataset.toText` and storing the resulting string
        in `localStorage`.
