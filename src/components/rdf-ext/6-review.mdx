<AuthorNote id="review" title="Should you choose rdf-ext?">
    Admittedly my demo-setup is very limited to show the full extent of RDF-Ext. It aims to be a full-fledged SDK for
    JavaScript developers who want to work with RDF graphs. My impression is that it offers a lot in that regard, but it
    lacks a bit in terms of communicating it. Although there's documentation for the main APIs, they're in some cases
    skeletons for later work. They have an impressive documentation of interfaces, but they're not available in
    TypeScript. That said, the module architecture of RDF-Ext is very good, and I've had little problem going into the
    code and figuring out how to define the types I needed.

    RDF-Ext offers some good features, like validation (using SHACL), SPARQL, [Node
    streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html), and generic front-end components. I also didn't go much into the
    traversing capabilities of [grapoi](https://github.com/rdf-ext/grapoi), which seems to be an intuitive and powerful
    way of traversing.

    So if all I've mentioned are features you need in your project, I would definitely recommend checking out RDF-Ext.
