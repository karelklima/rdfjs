    This demo requires you to authenticate with a Solid account.

    Ideally I would track the Grapoi object like I did in the local demo, but I'm opting out of `rdf.io.dataset.toURL`
    since it uses a `PUT` request to store the local RDF graph. I'm more comfortable using a `PATCH` request (together
    with a [SPARQL Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) query), so for this demo I'm constructing one
    manually. For this reason I only need to track the changes to the name, and only use the Grapoi API to fetch the
    initial name.

        In addition to setting up the name state, we get an update when we load the WebID, and then later when the user
        submits the form.

        I make sure to pass any error that occur to the `Demo` component.

    <CodeStep lines={["16-20"]} title="Fetching and parsing RDF graph from WebID resource">
        Using `rdf.io.dataset.fromURL` we get the dataset, which I then use to initiate a Grapoi object, which I then
        use to get the name.

                In order to make this demo work, I'm dependent on the WebID resource being publicly available. This is
                the default case for WebID resources on most Solid servers, so that shouldn't be a problem, but ideally
                we would pass on the [WHATWG Fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) function that `useSolidAuth`
                provides us. This is in development by the RDF-Ext team.

        While we wait for the name to be retrieved from the WebID resource, I display the `Loading` component.

    <CodeStep lines={["30-36"]} title="Update online resource">
        As mentioned earlier, I'm opting for writing a SPARQL UPDATE query in this demo, since I won't recommend using
        the `PUT` request like RDF-Ext would normally do. But the RDF-Ext team reassures me that there are options being
        worked on, and I'll update this demo as soon as possible.

        That said, If you're comfortable writing updates to your online resources using the `PUT` request, you can try
        using the `rdf.io.dataset.toURL` function.
