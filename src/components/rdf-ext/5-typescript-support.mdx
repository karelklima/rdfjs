    <h2>TypeScript support</h2>

    There is no out-of-the-box support for RDF-Ext. There's the community-managed
    [@types/rdf-ext](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@types/rdf-ext), but it probably won't be as updated as the main
    packages themselves.

    In the following code I've displayed the shims I've created to make my code work while I've been experimenting with
    the demos. It's far from complete, but should give you an idea of what to do if you want to work with RDF-Ext using
    TypeScript yourself. Note that I've reused types from [@rdfjs/types](https://github.com/rdfjs/types) in this shim,
    which is technically not correct, as RDF-Ext *extends* the RDF/JS data models, but it works for the demos.
