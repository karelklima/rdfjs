    Conflict-free Replicated Data Types are a fascinating technology that provides a protocol for handling replicas in a
    decentralized network. It doesn't require coordination between peers in the network to ensure consistent data
    models, but promises convergence *eventually*. These features are worded as the following on
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type):

    > 1. The application can update any replica independently, concurrently and without coordinating with other
    > replicas.
    > 2. An algorithm (itself part of the data type) automatically resolves any inconsistencies that might occur.
    > 3. Although replicas may have different state at any particular point in time, they are guaranteed to eventually
    > converge.
