    Conflict-free Replicated Data Types are a fascinating technology that provides a protocol for handling replicas in a
    decentralized network. It doesn't require coordination between peers in the network to ensure consistent data
    models, but promises convergence *eventually*. These features are worded as the following on
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type):

    > 1. The application can update any replica independently, concurrently and without coordinating with other
    > replicas.
    > 2. An algorithm (itself part of the data type) automatically resolves any inconsistencies that might occur.
    > 3. Although replicas may have different state at any particular point in time, they are guaranteed to eventually
    > converge.

    This means that given given that two or more nodes share the same starting point, e.g. "Helo", should be able to do
    changes to this value, e.g. "Hello" or "Helo!", and end up with the same state at the end, i.e. "Hello!" given the
    previous examples. This mean that when we're talking about CRDT implementations, we also need to describe the
    specific datatype it's for (e.g. CRDT for strings, CRDT for numbers, CRDT for lists).
