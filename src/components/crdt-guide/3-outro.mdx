<AuthorNote title="I'm no expert on CRDT">
    I'm somewhat confident in writing about the other guides on this website, but CRDT is a mostly unknown technology
    for me. But I wanted to write a little about it since I've included <NavLink to="/m-ld">m-ld</NavLink> in the
    list of libraries. So please read up on the recommended resources to learn more about it.
