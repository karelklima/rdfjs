    <h2 className="subtitle">Use Cases</h2>

    I've listed some common use cases you'll see for Linked Data. I'll describe how knowledge graphs are useful for each
    use case, and how Linked Data is even more useful.

    (I won't be using use cases as used in [software and systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case),
    using [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)-diagrams and such, but a more informal
    description of cases where knowledge graphs are useful ways to solve the problem.)
