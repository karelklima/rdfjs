    <h2 className="subtitle">Use Cases</h2>

    Below I've listed some common stereotypical use cases that knowledge graphs and semantic knowledge graphs are
    well-suited to handle. I'll describe how knowledge graphs are useful for each use case, and how semantic
    knowledge graphs are even more useful.

    I've tagged all of the use cases so you can more easily skim the topics that you're interested in. (There's
    a <NavLink to="#tags-description">list of descriptions for each tag</NavLink> at the bottom if you want to know more
    about what they denote).

    <Tags>{TAGS.map((tag) => <Tag key={tag.name} link={true} tag={tag}/>)}</Tags>

<AuthorNote title="On the term use case">
    I won't be using use cases as described in [software and systems
    engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case), using
    [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)-diagrams and such, but a more informal description of
    cases where knowledge graphs are useful ways to solve the problem.
