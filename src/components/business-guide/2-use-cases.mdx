    <h2 className="subtitle">Use Cases</h2>

    I've listed some common use cases you'll see for Linked Data. I'll describe how knowledge graphs are useful for each
    use case, and how Linked Data is even more useful.

    (I won't be using use cases as used in [software and systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case),
    using [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)-diagrams and such, but a more informal
    description of cases where knowledge graphs are useful ways to solve the problem.)

    I've tagged all of the use cases so you can more easily skim for the topics that you're interested in. You can click
    the tags for each use case, or you can select from the list below:

    <Tags>{TAGS.map((tag) => <Tag tag={tag}/>)}</Tags>

    There's a list of descriptions of each tag after the use cases.

    <h3 className="subtitle">Description of tags</h3>
    <p>I'm adding this section since it's useful to know that we aren't using the same terms for different meanings.</p>
    <table className="table is-striped is-">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Label</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        {TAGS.map(({label, description}) => (
            <tr>
                <td>{label}</td>
                <td>{description}</td>
            </tr>
        ))}
