    <h2 className="subtitle">Use Cases</h2>

    I've listed some common use cases you'll see for Linked Data. I'll describe how knowledge graphs are useful for each
    use case, and how Linked Data is even more useful.

    I've tagged all of the use cases so you can more easily skim for the topics that you're interested in. You can click
    the tags for each use case, or you can select from the list below (there's a <NavLink to="#tags-description">list
    of descriptions for each tag</NavLink> below if you want to know more specifically what they denote).

    <Tags>{TAGS.map((tag) => <Tag key={tag.name} link={true} tag={tag}/>)}</Tags>

<AuthorNote title="On the term use case">
    I won't be using use cases as described in [software and systems
    engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case), using
    [UML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language)-diagrams and such, but a more informal description of
    cases where knowledge graphs are useful ways to solve the problem.
