    <h2 className="subtitle">Linked Data offers unique solutions</h2>

    Whatever you end up taking from this website, I hope the minimum thing is that you see how Linked Data is a viable
    option for many organizations. It's base in human language makes it a tool that can be (more easily) communicated
    across those having a problem needed solving and trying to communicate it to those trying to implement a solution.

    Linked Data can be a bit hard to get your head around. It's both very simple and complex at the same time - that's
    natural when you have an abstraction that works with how we use language and that tries to mirror that in a formal
    way that can be interpreted by computers.

    But if you're able to look beyond that complexity, and see the unique possibilities these technologies offer, then
    you might become part of a growing eco-system that I believe will improve the lives of all people.
