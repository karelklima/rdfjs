    Are you a system developer who wants to find business arguments to convey your organization about the
    possibilities of RDF. Or are you a business developer who wants to understand how to fit RDF into your
    portfolio? This guide is for both of you, to make it easier for both of you to understand how RDF can be used to
    solve real-world problems.

    So, in the spirit of common language, let's **use the term *Linked Data* instead of RDF**. RDF is a <abbr
    title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> (the joke here being that TLA is itself a three-letter acronym), i.e. not
    very accessible for those outside the know. Linked Data at least gives an inkling of what it's about: **linking
    *meaningful* data together in knowledge graphs**.

    Knowledge graph *is* a very useful term nowadays since the word itself has become popular, but be aware that the
    implementations of knowledge graphs may vary greatly. That said, they are a useful abstraction to get your head into
    the common properties. Throughout this text I'll be very firm about the use of the words Knowledge Graph and Linked
    Data. **Knowledge Graph** will denote the *abstraction of knowledge graphs*, while **Linked Data** will denote the
    *specific type of knowledge graph using RDF*. (There, that's the last time I'll use that TLA for this text.)
