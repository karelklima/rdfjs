    Are you a system developer who wants to find business arguments to convey your organization about the
    possibilities of RDF. Or are you a business developer who wants to understand how to fit RDF into your
    portfolio? This guide is for both of you, to make it easier for both of you to understand how RDF can be used to
    solve real-world problems.

    So, in the spirit of common language, let's **use the term *Semantic Knowledge Graphs* instead of RDF**. RDF is
    a <abbr title="Three-Letter Acronym">TLA</abbr> (the joke here being that TLA is itself a three-letter acronym),
    i.e. not very accessible for those outside the know. Semantic knowledge graphs at least gives an inkling of what
    it's about: ***meaningful* data in knowledge graphs**.

    Knowledge graph is a useful term nowadays in that it has become popular and is somewhat self-explanatory. But be
    aware that the implementations of knowledge graphs may vary greatly. So in order to be specific I'll use the
    words *Knowledge Graph* and *Semantic Knowledge Graph*: **Knowledge Graph** will denote the *general abstraction of
    knowledge graphs*, while **semantic knowledge graphs** will denote the *specific type of knowledge graph using RDF*.
    (There, that's the last time I'll use that TLA for this text ^_^)
