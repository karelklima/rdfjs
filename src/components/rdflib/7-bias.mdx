<AuthorNote title="My bias with rdflib.js">
    I should make it clear that I've worked with rdflib.js many times throughout the years (first time when I was
    writing my [master thesis](https://graphitethesis.icanhasweb.net/)). I've also [worked on
    rdflib.js](https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js/commits?author=megoth) some years ago, but I think I'm unbiased
    enough to give a fair review.
