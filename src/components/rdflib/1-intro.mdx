    Rdflib.js is probably _the_ longest ongoing project that allow developers to manage RDF. It's used in many projects,
    such as [the SolidOS project](https://github.com/SolidOS/solidos). Its API consists of low-level and high-level
    parts. The lower level API requires a healthy bit of understanding RDF, while the higher level API allows you to
    interact with RDF resources more easily. I would argue that the form of some of the functions are a bit outdated,
    such as `serialize` where the last parameter is a callback function. This eludes back to how callbacks were handled
    before promises were a thing in JavaScript.

    The API is extensive, and should have you covered in most situations. The low-level API does not bring me joy when
    working with it, so in general I would recommend _not_ using it for front-end projects, unless you're very dependent
    on working with a very stable API.
