        The API is extensive, and should cover most of your RDF-related needs. It has limited
        [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) support, allowing a subset of queries. That said, working with
        rdflib.js' API nowadays feels antiquated, and I've always had to struggle to make it work with state-management
        libraries like React.

        The documentation is useful, but it's not complete and a bit hard to navigate at times. Also, the project can
        be confused by [Python's rdflib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/) when using a search engine, especially if
        you're new to RDF, which is less than ideal.

        The community for rdflib.js is not very active, but there are people out there that will step in to help if you
        have problems (usually through channels like
        [linkeddata/rdflib.js Matrix chat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#linkeddata_rdflib.js:gitter.im)). The library
        has had many developers throughout the years (myself included), and some of these will pitch in when needed.

        Although the response can be good, and the people welcoming, the code base of rdflib.js is quite hard to manage
        at times. This means that bug can take a long time to be fixed. Luckily, the library has been out for a long
        time, and it has proven reliable in preserving its APIs.

        rdflib.js is probably the oldest JavaScript library that supports RDF. Hence, it's sports a test and tried API
        that you can be sure have most bugs discovered.

        rdflib.js offers a robust experience that allows you to engage with RDF with a low-level API, but also interact
        with RDF resources with a high-level API. It requires you to know how RDF works to use most of it, but rewards
        you with a stable and reliant API. In my opinion the API also suffers from its age, most prominently shown in
        asynchronous functions like `parse` and `serialize` that relies on callbacks. It's philosophy on having a global
        store is also not necessarily aligned with component-specific scopes, but since it's not forced upon you, it's
        not a big problem.

        I <u>**would use**</u> rdflib.js if you're dependent on a stable library with an extensive low-level API plus
        some useful helper utilities for online interaction. I <u>**would not use**</u> it in most web apps since it
        forces you to get into the nitty gritty of low-level RDF data management.
