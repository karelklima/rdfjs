        When working with online resources we want to make use of `Fetcher` and `UpdateManager` to respectively
        load and update the resources.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["18"]} title="Loading data and setting name">
        Using the fetcher we load the resource, and once it's done fetching we find the name (if set). An
        important side-effect here is that `store` is updated as well with `fetcher.load`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["22-25"]} title="Submitting data and updating name">
        Upon submitting the form, a new triple with the name is inserted while the old name is removed in
        another triple. The updated store is then posted to the online resource, where rdflib.js will break
        down the updates into a [SPARQL Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) query. After
        successfully updating the resource, we make sure to update the name internally.
