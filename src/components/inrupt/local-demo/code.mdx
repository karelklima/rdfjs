    This demo saves the underlying turtle in `localStorage`. It no turtle is found, a default one is used:

    <CodeStep lines={["15-16"]} title="Setting up dataset and turtle">
        The type of objects that we usually start with is `SolidDataset` from the
        [resource/solidDataset](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/api/javascript/solid-client/modules/resource_solidDataset.html)
        module. We also prepare a turtle string since we're working locally.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["17-18"]} title="Getting profile and name">
        We also set up the variables `profile` and `name`, which respectively represent the thing retrieved as
        profile and the literal name. The latter is important to pass on for the `Demo` component we fetch the
        profile from the dataset that's currently used.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["21-26"]} title="Parsing turtle and updating dataset">
        @inrupt/solid-client doesn't provide all the tools necessary for loading a turtle locally, so we've made
        use of [N3.js](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js) to parse the turtle string. Since N3 returns [RDF/JS
        Dataset](https://rdf.js.org/dataset-spec/), we can parse it using `fromRdfJsDataset`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["29-31"]} title="Loading state">
        Since parsing the initial turtle string can take a little time, we show the `Loading` component
        while we wait for it to complete and update the dataset. Usually this goes very fast though.

        Do note that the error handling here is bad, since there are changes that the dataset or profile
        turns up `null`. But I've simplified the code for readability, so I accept this flaw.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["34-41"]} title="Updating RDF upon submit">
        When submitting we get get thing we want to update, the profile, and update the literal that was set for
        `foaf:name`. We then update the dataset with the updated thing, and proceed to serialize the updated
        dataset, again with the help of N3.js.
