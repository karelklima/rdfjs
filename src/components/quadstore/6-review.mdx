<AuthorNote id="review" title="Should you choose Quadstore?">
    I haven't used Quadstore enough to confidently review it. But it's low-level API seems to be efficient, and having
    SPARQL capabilities is impressive. The fact that you can choose between various backends that implements [the
    AbstractLevel interface](https://github.com/level/abstract-level) is also impressive, and should provide a lot of
    options to developers looking for low-level tools to handle RDF.
