    Quadstore is a low-level library that implements the `Sink`, `Source`, and `Store` [RDF/JS
    specifications](https://rdf.js.org/) in TypeScript. It supports SPARQL queries via
    [quadstore-comunica](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quadstore-comunica), a tailored configuration of the [Comunica
    querying framework](https://comunica.dev/).

    It works with any storage backend that implements [the AbstractLevel
    interface](https://github.com/level/abstract-level), of which there is an incomplete list of available backends at
    [level/awesome#stores](https://github.com/level/awesome#stores).
