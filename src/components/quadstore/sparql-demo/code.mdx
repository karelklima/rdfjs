<Content>
    This demo is very similar to the <NavLink to="#local">local demo</NavLink> except that it uses <NavLink
    to="/sparql">SPARQL queries</NavLink> to find and update name to the underlying RDF graph. To enable this I pull in
    [quadstore-comunica](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quadstore-comunica), which is a SPARQL query engine built
    on <NavLink to="/comunica">the Comunica framework</NavLink> and implementing [the RDF/JS Query
    specification](https://rdf.js.org/query-spec/).

<Code language="tsx" id="QuadstoreSparqlDemo" code={demoCode} className="line-numbers">
    <CodeStep lines={["11-16"]} title="Setting up backend, store, and engine">
        As with the local demo, backend and store is set up using BrowserLevel and Quadstore. But in addition I also
        pull in quadstore-comunica as SPARQL engine.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["17", "22-28"]} title="Getting name from storage">
        I want to retrieve name from the IndexedDB API if possible, which is done after opening the store with
        `store.open`. If no name is found I set the name to "Test" by default.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["18", "29", "37", "43"]} title="Error handling">
        I keep track of any errors that might occur and pass them to the `Demo` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["32-34"]} title="Loading state">
        It can take some time to get everything ready, so while we wait I show the `Loading` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["36-45"]} title="Update RDF graph and make it persistent">
        When the user submits the form I use `engine.queryVoid` to replace the name in the underlying RDF graph.
        Quadstore handles the persistent storage with the IndexedDB API using BrowserLevel.
    </CodeStep>
