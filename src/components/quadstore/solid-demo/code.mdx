    This demo requires you to authenticate with a Solid account. It is similar to the <NavLink to="#local">Local
    demo</NavLink>, but parses and serializes data from and to Turtle using N3.js.

<Code language="tsx" id="QuadstoreSolidDemo" code={demoCode} className="line-numbers">
    <CodeStep lines={["12"]} title="Getting webId and fetch">
        This demo requires logging in with a Solid account, and we retrieve the `webId` and `fetch` using `useSolidAuth`
        from [@ldo/solid-react](https://ldo.js.org/api/solid-react/).
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["13-17"]} title="Setting up backend and store">
        In this demo I use your Solid WebID resource as persistent storage, and I don't want to use `localStorage` like
        I used in the previous demos. Instead I use [MemoryLevel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memory-level) which
        stores data in the memory.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["21-42"]} title="Parsing WebID resource and getting name">
        Quadstore doesn't provide API to parse <NavLink to="/rdf#serializations">RDF serializations</NavLink> itself, so
        I use the Parser class in N3.js to handle it. The quads are described using RDF/JS Data Model standard, which
        allows me to pass the quads from N3.js to Quadstore store using `store.multiPut`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["19", "39-41", "49", "63"]} title="Error handling">
        I keep track of any errors that might occur and pass them to the `Demo` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["44-46"]} title="Loading state">
        It can take some time to fetch and parse the RDF from the WebID resource, so while we wait I show the `Loading`
        component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["48-65"]} title="Update RDF graph and online resource">
        When the user submits the form I use `store.multiPatch` to replace the name in the underlying RDF graph. Next, I
        pass a [SPARQL Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/) query (which is supported by Solid servers) to
        update the WebID resource.
