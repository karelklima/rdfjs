    In this example we list all triples in a graph. We've assigned the variables `?subject`, `?predicate`, and `?object`
    to catch the corresponding subjects, predicates, and objects. But this example is very generic, so it helps to see a
    more specific example.

    In the example we query for the value of `foaf:name` for the subject `{PROFILE_URI}`. If we were able
    to execute SPARQL-queries (which [Comunica](https://comunica.dev/) allows us to do), we could use this query by
    simply swap out the subject with the WebID the user has authenticated themselves with.
