    Writing SPARQL queries in JavaScript can be a bit tedious, even when you're familiar with SPARQL. So to help there
    are libraries that implement the [Builder pattern](https://www.dofactory.com/javascript/design-patterns/builder),
    allowing us to build our queries in steps.

    Before we start our examples, lets see how the string-based approach could look:

    One way to build your string is to use [rdf-sparql-builder](https://github.com/rdf-ext/rdf-sparql-builder). It
    provides you with simple API that maps onto the SPARQL queries.

    Another library that provide you with a SPARQL builder API is
    [@tpluscode/sparql-builder](https://github.com/tpluscode/sparql-builder). This leans more into [template
    literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals):

    No matter which approach you choose, know that SPARQL is a fundamental part of the semantic web for a reason. If
    you're going to work with larger RDF graphs you'll inevitably come into needs that SPARQL can meet. So if you're
    leaning into that RDF is a good thing, you might want to spend some cycles reading up on SPARQL as well.
