    [Soukai](https://soukai.js.org/) is a project by Noel De Martin where he tries to create an easy way to manage
    non-relational database objects in JavaScript. It uses various engines as adapters for various storages, e.g. you
    can switch engines depending on whether you want to store data in memory, `localStorage`, or an online resource
    (like a Solid Pod).

    For the last use-case Noel has developed [Soukai Solid](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid), which
    extends the model proposed by "core" Soukai so that it's interoperable with RDF.
