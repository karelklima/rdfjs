    [Soukai ODM](https://soukai.js.org/) is a project by Noel De Martin where he tries to create an easy way to manage
    non-relational database objects in JavaScript. It uses various engines as adapters for various storages, e.g. you
    can switch engines depending on whether you want to store data in memory or in an online resource.

    For the latter use-case Noel has developed [Soukai Solid](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid), which
    extends the model proposed by "core" Soukai so that it's interoperable with RDF.
