<AuthorNote id="review" title="Should you choose Soukai?">
    I haven't worked enough with Soukai to write a proper review. You should check out the official website and maybe
    even talk with its creator, [Noel De Martin](https://noeldemartin.com/), to figure out whether this library is good
    choice for you.

    That being said, my impression of Soukai is that it gets far in its goal to describe what is essentially shapes,
    but doing it by using JavaScript syntax. In that way it's somewhat similar to <NavLink to="/ldo">LDO</NavLink>,
    although LDO takes it a step further (in the right direction IMO) by using a shape standard, ShEx.

    There are arguments for and against this choice:

    * **Pro:** By using the syntax of the programming language your developers will use you lessen the amount of new
    technology your developers need to learn.
    * **Con:** By not using a standard you might make it harder for people who don't have a JS-background but who're
    going to work together with you on the data model.

    I'm also of the impression that the adoption of Soukai is a bit limited, so I'm not sure about the size of its
    community.

    **The biggest upside for Soukai**, IMHO, is the ability to switch between engines dynamically. The ability to switch
    from `localStorage` to Solid storage, allowing users to start doing their work offline and then save it to their Pod
    when needed, is very interesting, and might be the winning point for many apps. (To be fair, this can also be done
    with the other libraries, but they don't offer this feature out of the box <abbr
    title="As Far As I Know">AFAIK</abbr>.)
