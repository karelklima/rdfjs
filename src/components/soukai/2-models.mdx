    A vital part of Soukai is defining models by extending the `Model` class in `soukai`, but to enable support for RDF
    we make use of the `SolidModel` class in `soukai-solid`.

    For our demos we've created the model `PersonModel` that is reused by both demos:

<Code id="PersonModel" language="typescript" code={PersonCode} noCopy={true} className="line-numbers">
    <CodeStep lines={["5"]} title={"Setting type"}>
        By setting the static field `rdfsClasses` we tell Soukai the types for this model.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["8-12"]} title={"Defining field name"}>
        Again we only define attribute for the model, name, which is not required.
    </CodeStep>
</Code>
