    <h1 className="title">LDO</h1>

    [Linked Data Objects (LDO)](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/) is a set of libraries that focus around using
    <StyledLink href="/shex">ShEx shapes</StyledLink> to describe data you want to interact with. It's still new and
    some parts are in alpha (or just simply experimental), but it shows great promises for developers who enjoy using
    types in their work (such as me). By transpiling the ShEx shapes into JSON-objects and TypeScript types and
    utilizing [JavaScript Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)
    it provides some smart APIs.
