    [Linked Data Objects (LDO)](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/) is a set of libraries that focus around using
    <NavLink to="/shex">ShEx shapes</NavLink> to describe data you want to interact with. It's still new and some parts
    are in alpha (or just simply experimental), but it shows great promises for developers who enjoy using types in
    their work (such as me). By transpiling the ShEx shapes into JSON-objects and TypeScript types and utilizing
    [JavaScript Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) it
    provides some smart APIs.
