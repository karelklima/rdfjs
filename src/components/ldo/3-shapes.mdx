    <h2 className="title">Shapes</h2>

    In the demos shown below I've used shapes from my project
    [ldo-solid-profile](https://github.com/megoth/ldo-solid-profile). It's a TypeScript project that publishes a NPM
    package with the resulting files from [@ldo/cli](https://github.com/o-development/ldo/tree/main/packages/cli). It's
    an attempt at creating a client-to-client standard that allow developers to agree on a fixed shape of the WebID
    profile, what I call `SolidProfile`.

    This is the code for that ShEx shape:

<Code id="ProfileTurtle" language="turtle" code={profileShex}/>

    This can definitely be improved upon, but it is a starting point for something that is hopefully useful (I'm using
    for the demos here at least, so I'm finding it useful).

    But know that setting up LDO requires a bit of work, especially if you are amongst the first adopters. Until there's
    a wide community of contributors of shapes, there's going to be an uphill battle for recruiting developers. But I
    think the benefits of semantic technologies outweigh the challenges of adoption.
