    This demo saves the underlying turtle in `localStorage`. It no turtle is found, a default one is used:

    <CodeStep lines={["12-13"]} title="Setting up profile and turtle">
        We're creating an artificial profile until we've loaded the proper one from storage (or as fallback in case it
        fails to load). For the turtle we have a default turtle that we use if none is stored in `localStorage`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["14", "19", "27", "29", "33"]} title="Error handling">
        There are a couple of things that can go wrong when working with this demo. First, there might go something
        wrong when parsing, e.g. the turtle text could be invalid. Second, something might go wrong when we serialize
        the RDF graph back to turtle text. Any error is passed to the `Demo` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["17-18"]} title="Parsing turtle and updating profile">
        When we have some turtle to process, we parse it with LDO's `parseRdf`, an asynchronous function that
        returns `ldoDataset`, a variable of type `LdoDataset`, which is a very useful LDO object. From this
        dataset we retrieve the object representing a subject in the dataset. This way we can retrieve the
        profile, and update our code.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["22-24"]} title="Loading state">
        While we wait for the turtle to parse, we simply show the `Loading` component.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["28-30"]} title="Updating name and storage">
        These is where the beauty of LDO really shines through. Updating name is as simple as setting a new
        value to `profile.name`. Next, we simply serialize the updated turtle using `toTurtle`.
    </CodeStep>
