    This demo saves the underlying turtle in `localStorage`. It no turtle is found, a default one is used:

    <CodeStep lines={["10-11"]} title="Setting up profile and turtle">
        We're setting a `null` for profile until we've loaded one from storage. For the turtle we have a
        default turtle that we use if none is stored in `localStorage`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["14-17"]} title="Parsing turtle and updating profile">
        When we have some turtle to process, we parse it with LDO's `parseRdf`, an asynchronous function that
        returns `ldoDataset`, a variable of type `LdoDataset`, which is a very useful LDO object. From this
        dataset we retrieve the object representing a subject in the dataset. This way we can retrieve the
        profile, and update our code.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["20-22"]} title="Loading state">
        While we wait for the turtle to parse, we simply show the `Loading` component. One drawback of this
        solution is that we might simply not find a profile object, in which case we would show the demo to be
        loading indefinitely. So there should be some error handling here, but I wanted to keep this code
        simple.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["25-26"]} title="Updating name and storage">
        These is where the beauty of LDO really shines through. Updating name is as simple as setting a new
        value to `profile.name`. Next, we simply serialize the updated turtle using `toTurtle`.
    </CodeStep>
