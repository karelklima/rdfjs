    <h2 className="subtitle">Beyond JavaScript</h2>

    I hope this guide hasn't been overwhelming to read. JavaScript has a lot to offer, and you should create stuff with
    it to really understand what it can do. There are also useful abstractions **on top** of JavaScript again, such as
    TypeScript and other programming languages that transpile to JavaScript.
