    JavaScript (JS) is a popular programming language that has become one of the core technologies of the web we know
    today. JS is mostly known for its use in websites, but have in recent years started to become popular in many
    non-browser environments as well, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which allows you to run JavaScript as
    programmes on your computer, e.g. it can be used to write servers ([Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a really
    good framework here if you want to check it out). Even though it started as a simple way "to make web
    pages alive", it's now a well supported programming language with flexibility to support both objective and
    functional programming styles (or a mix of both).

    Formally JavaScript is standardized as ECMAScript, which is maintained by [Technical Committee 39](https://tc39.es/)
    (often abbreviated TC39), which is part of [ECMA International](https://ecma-international.org/), which is an
    industry association dedicated to standardization. The implementations are often called JavaScript engines, and is
    implemented by various browsers, e.g. [V8](https://v8.dev/) is used by Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers,
    and [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev/) is used by Mozilla Firefox and its forks. For the simplicity of this
    text we'll refer to ECMAScript as JS as well.

    JS is designed to be simple and secure (but doesn't shy away from being complex if the functionality it
    provides is inherently complex). Most browsers have some sort of sandbox-environment so that websites don't affect
    each other in a malicious way.

    In this guide I'll go through some basic concepts of JavaScript so that you can more easily understand the code
    examples on this website. You might also want to read the guides on <NavLink
    to="/typescript">TypeScript</NavLink> and <NavLink to="/react">React</NavLink>, as they are two important
    JavaScript-related technologies used on this website. I won't go into to much detail, for that I recommend you
    to check out the <NavLink to="#recommendations">list of recommendations</NavLink>.
