    <h3 className="subtitle">Modules</h3>

    Modules have been JavaScript for a long time, but there has been some debate as to how they should be formalized.
    For this reason there are actually multiple standards for writing modules in JS. This can quickly become very
    complex, which is beyond the scope of this guide. But if you want to learn more about it, I recommend reading this
    <a href={"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules"}>document on JavaScript Modules
        at <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr></a>.

    For this guide we'll limit outselves to `import` and `export` which is part of the [ECMAScript
    modules](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/es-modules/) syntax.

<Code id="ModulesSyntax" language="typescript" code={modulesSyntax} noCopy={true} className="line-numbers">
    <CodeStep lines={["1-2"]} title={<code>import</code>}>
        When we want to import code from other modules we use `import`.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["4"]} title={<code>export default</code>}>
        This is how we export the default part of our exported module. Here we also see an example of aliases, where
        `aliasDoSomething` becomes an alias for `doSomethingElse`. There can only be one default export in each module.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["5-6"]} title={<code>export</code>}>
        If we want to export multiple things from a module, this is how we can do that.
    </CodeStep>

    <h4 className="subtitle">NPM</h4>

    Modules are very handy ways of sharing code, and [Node Packaging Module](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a popular system
    to publish and download JS packages. Although it has it flaws, it's still a very useful tool, and is the default way
    of handling dependencies in Node-based systems.

    There are also alternatives to NPM, such as [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Going into
    details into any of these are beyond the scope of this guide, but it can be useful to know about the alternatives.
