        Functions are very useful parts of our code, and we can pass them around as we want. This and the next example
        are probably the most common ways of writing functions.

    <CodeStep lines={["5"]} title={"Anonymous functions"}>
        A shorthand way of writing functions can be seen on line 5. Anonymous functions don't have a name, so they
        aren't as convenient to call as named functions, but they can be assigned to anything, so we can

    <CodeStep lines={["7-13"]} title={"Methods"}>
        When we have functions as properties on objects/maps, we call them methods. We also get access to the `this`
        syntax in methods, which refers to the object they're assigned to. `this` is a powerful feature of JS (like
        any <abbr title="Object-Oriented">OO</abbr>-based programming language), but should be used with care, as it can
        be hard to know what exactly `this` refers to.

        In general I would advise programming styles that avoid the use of `this` (functional programming has a lot to
        offer in this regard).
