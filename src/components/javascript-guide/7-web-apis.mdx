    Now we've covered most of the basic syntax of JS. But this is only scratching the surface of what JS can do, as
    there a slew of APIs available to enhance your website (or server, or any other kind of JS-based program). Browser
    APIs offer useful way of accessing data from your browser (such as the `localStorage` property on the `window`
    API, which allows you to store data between sessions (i.e. visits that the user makes to the website).

    To see the full list of APIs, check out [Mozilla's list of Web
    APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).
