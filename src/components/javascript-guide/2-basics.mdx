    <h2 className="subtitle">Basic syntax</h2>

    JavaScript supports a small set of literals (strings, numbers, dates, date-times) and data structures (arrays,
    maps, sets). They all extends the basic datatype in JavaScript, `Object`, through what we call
    [prototypical
    inheritance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain) (this is
    beyond the scope of this guide, but I'll mention it in case you want to know more). Functions are also
    object-oriented in that they're treated as first-class objects, amd they can be passed around to facilitate a
    functional programming style.

    JavaScript code is composed by statements, which is composed of tokens. A simple rule is to keep one statement per
    line, but JavaScript has a lot of short-hand syntax that allow you to write powerful lines of code (which is not
    necessarily advisable in all situations).

    Below are some types of syntax that you can see throughout JavaScript programmes (the important thing here is not to
    memorize this, but to understand what you can do with the basics of JavaScript).

    <CodeStep lines={["1-3"]} title={"Variables"}>
        JS offers multiple types of variables, `var`, `let`, and `const`. They differ in their affordances, e.g.
        `var` and `let` are similar in that they both can be changed (i.e. they are not constants), but `let` is
        narrower in that they're scoped by the immediate enclosing block denoted by `{}`, not the whole function body.
        (This might sound cryptic, but the only thing you need to know for now is that they are useful distinctions, and
        that you should stick to `let` and `const` if you can.)

        `const` are constants, and cannot be changed once they're set. But one important thing to note here is that for
        data structures the constant is only the initial reference. That means that even though `foo` is a constant
        in `const foo = {}`, we can still do `foo.bar = 42` to append the attribute `bar` with the value `42` the object
        `foo`.

    <CodeStep lines={["5-8"]} title={"Literals"}>
        There are many types of literals in JavaScript that represent useful values. These offer ways to be combined,
        but might also lead to some WTF-moments ([wtfjs.com](https://wtfjs.com/) is a very amusing website to explore in
        this regard).

        Do also note that there are multiple ways of representing string; You can use single quotation marks, double
        quotations marks, or [Template
        Literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). Especially the
        latter is useful when you need larger strings that go over multiple lines, and when you want to replace parts
        of the string with variables. I've shown examples of these different types of strings in <CodeLink
        id="BasicJavaScriptSyntax" lines={["29", "33", "36"]}>lines 29, 33, and 36</CodeLink>.
    </CodeStep>
    <CodeStep lines={["10-17"]} title={"Data structures"}>
        You can combine variables and literals as you like in arrays, maps (which are the same as key-value objects),
        and sets. JavaScript is dynamic, so you can mix and match as you want (but you probably shouldn't - it's easier
        to keep tracks of arrays and maps when their values are of the same form. That said, there are many situations
        where it's useful to have dynamic values, and JS provides that.

        An important feature of `Set` is that all entries are unique. So in the case we see at line 17 we'll get a set
        with two entries, `numberVariable` (which we tried to add twice) and `stringVariable`.
