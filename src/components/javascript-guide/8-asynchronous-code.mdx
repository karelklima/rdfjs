    <h3 className="subtitle">Asynchronous code</h3>

    One last concept that I want to introduce to you is **asynchronous code**. This is a useful concept to know when
    dealing with online resources, since they introduce latency and doesn't work in the normal, synchronous way.

    But what does it mean that our code is asynchronous? To understand that better, let's look at synchronous code:

<Code language="typescript" code={synchronousCode}/>

    In this code we simply do one thing after another. This code is very easy to read and follow.

    Asynchronous code can be harder to follow:

<Code language="typescript" code={asynchronousCode}/>

    In this code we introduce `setTimeout`, which is a method on the `window` API. This allows us to indicate a number
    of milliseconds (1000 in our case, meaning 1 second). This means that the order of the outputted strings are: `foo`,
    `baz`, `bar`.

    Another important API for asynchronous code are
    [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), which is a
    handy way of abstracting something (a promise) that will be **resolved** at *some point in the future*, e.g. loading
    a resource over an internet connection.
