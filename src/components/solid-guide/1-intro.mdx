    <h1 className="title">Solid</h1>

    One way of starting to understand Solid is to read [about Solid on
    solidproject.org](https://solidproject.org/about):

    <blockquote cite="https://solidproject.org/about">
        Solid is a specification that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called Pods.
        Pods are like secure personal web servers for your data.
    </blockquote>

    Now, although Solid formally is "just" a specification, it's commonly used to refer to broader concepts, such
    as what Solid promises for the individual user. One great quote to explain this from the page [What is
    Solid](https://www.womenofsolid.org/what-is-solid) from [Women of Solid](https://www.womenofsolid.org/).

    <blockquote cite="https://www.womenofsolid.org/what-is-solid">
        The goal of solid is that users have control over their data. This is accomplished by putting all the user data
        in a Solid Pod, which the user controls. The user can then decide with which people and apps they want to share
        their data, which data they want to share, and what kind of access they want to give to users or apps. They can
        also revoke access at any time.

        With Solid, the app and the data are decoupled. This means that users can access their data through whatever app
        they prefer.
    </blockquote>

    This is what the community is centered around, working toward making this goal a reality (through standardization
    with a specification). The Solid community has grown into a complex being, with a lot of forces pulling into various
    directions, but they're united in the goal of making Solid a viable standard for decentralized data. If you want to
    get into the community I suggest to check out the various Solid community tools that I've listed down below, like
    chats and various projects.
