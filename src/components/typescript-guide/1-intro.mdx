    [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of JavaScript, adding additional syntax. By allowing us
    to type our interfaces we can communicate to other developers how to use our work. Although not often, sometimes
    you'll see the use of types in the JavaScript-code on this website. That's because it's actually TypeScript that's
    shown. Although not necessary, I find TypeScript eases my workflow as a developer, and I appreciate tools that allow
    me to elevate types.
